# Bike Sharing Project

For the first project, we'll build a neural network to predict bike-sharing rides. 

The output displays the optimum number of bikes that should be kept in the store by the studying various aspects like weather, humidity, days of the week.

************************************************************************

Produces good results when running the network on full data            .
The activation function is a sigmoid                                   .
The backpropagation implementation is correct                          .
The forward pass implementation is correct                             .
The learning_rate is reasonable                                        .
The number of epochs is reasonable                                     .
The number of hidden nodes is reasonable                               .
The number of output nodes is correct                                  .
The run method is correct                                              .
The update_weights implementation is correct                           .
The weights are updated correctly on training                          .
