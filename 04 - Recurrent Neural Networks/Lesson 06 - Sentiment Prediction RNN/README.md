# Note

To be able to run these notebooks, you need to do the following:

 - Create a new folder and call it "data"
 - Download the [reviews](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/sentiment-network/reviews.txt) and [labels](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/sentiment-network/labels.txt).
 - Put the downloaded data into the newly-created folder "data"

Now, you can start coding!!
